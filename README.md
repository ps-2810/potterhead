Express backend that creates a simple REST API for managing tasks. This project includes endpoints for retrieving a list of tasks, getting a specific task by ID, creating a new task, updating an existing task, and deleting a task. The tasks are stored in-memory for simplicity. The server runs on http://localhost:3000, and you can test the API using tools like Postman.
